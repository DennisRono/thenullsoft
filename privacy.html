                <p>
                    Your privacy is important to us. It is denniskibet's policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including across our website, https://denniskibet.com, and other sites we own and operate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This policy is effective as of 7 February 2022 and was last updated on 7 February 2022.
                </p>
                <h2 class="title">Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    When you visit the Site, I automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, I collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. I refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”<br/>
                    I collect Device Information using the following technologies:<br/>
                    - <strong>“Cookies”</strong> are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.<br/>
                    - <strong>Log Data</strong> When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser. It may include your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, other details about your visit, and technical details that occur in conjunction with any errors you may encounter. <br/>
                    - <strong>“Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels”</strong> are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.<br/>
                    Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, I collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers), email address, and phone number. I refer to this information as “Order Information.”<br/>
                    When I talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, I am talking both about Device Information and Order Information.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons.
                </p>
                <h1 class="title">HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h1>
                <p>
                    I use the Order Information that I collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, I use this Order Information to:<br/>
                    Communicate with you;<br/>
                    Screen my orders for potential risk or fraud; and<br/>
                    When in line with the preferences you have shared with me, provide you with information or advertising relating to my products or services.<br/>
                    I use the Device Information that I collect to help me screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize my Site (for example, by generating analytics about how my customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of my marketing and advertising campaigns).<br/>
                </p>
                <h1 class="title">
                    Legitimate Reasons for Processing Your Personal Information
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We only collect and use your personal information when we have a legitimate reason for doing so. In which instance, we only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary to provide our services to you.
                </p>
                <h1 class="title">SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>
                <p>
                    I share your Personal Information with third parties to help me use your Personal Information, as described above. For example, I use Google Analytics to help me understand how my customers use the Site--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.<br/>
                    Finally, I may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information I receive, or to otherwise protect my rights.<br/>
                </p>
                <h1 class="title">BEHAVIOURAL ADVERTISING</h1>
                <p>
                    As described above, I use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications I believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.<br/>
                    You can opt out of targeted advertising by:<br/>
                    FACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads<br/>
                    GOOGLE - https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous<br/>
                    BING - https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-me/resources/policies/personalized-ads<br/>
                    Additionally, you can opt out of some of these services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out portal at: http://optout.aboutads.info/.<br/>
                </p>
                <h1 class="title">Security of Your Personal Information</h1>
                <p>
                When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.
                <br/>
                Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security. We will comply with laws applicable to us in respect of any data breach.
                <br/>
                You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the bounds of our services.
                </p>
                <h1 class="title">DO NOT TRACK</h1>
                <p>
                    Please note that I do not alter my Site’s data collection and use practices when I see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.<br/>
                </p>
                <h1 class="title">YOUR RIGHTS</h1>
                <p>

                    Additionally, if you are a European resident I note that I am processing your information in order to fulfill contracts I might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Site), or otherwise to pursue my legitimate business interests listed above. Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.<br/>
                    The personal information we collect is stored and/or processed where we or our partners, affiliates, and third-party providers maintain facilities. Please be aware that the locations to which we store, process, or transfer your personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. If we transfer your personal information to third parties in other countries: (i) we will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of applicable law; and (ii) we will protect the transferred personal information in accordance with this privacy policy.<br/>
                    <strong>Your Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information</strong><br/>

                    <br/>
                    If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time.

Please be aware we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity.
                    <br/>
                    If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, please contact us using the details provided in this privacy policy. We will take reasonable steps to correct any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or out of date.
                    <br/>

                <h1 class="title">How Long We Keep Your Personal Information (DATA RETENTION)</h1>
                <p>
                    When you place an order through the Site, I will maintain your Order Information for my records unless and until you ask me to delete this information.<br/>
                    We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. If your personal information is no longer required, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.
                    <br/>
                    However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.
                </p>
                <h1 class="title">Children’s Privacy</h1>
